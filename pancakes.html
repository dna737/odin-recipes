     <h2>The good ol' pancakes with butter combo :D</h2>
     <p>Although it sounds simple (and honestly boring), it tastes pretty darn good!</p>
     <p>And yeah, lazy college students (like me) love it! </p>

     <h2>Ingredients requried:</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
         <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
         <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>
         <li>1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
         <li>1¼ cups milk </li>
         <li>1 egg </li>
         <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Instructions:</h2>

     <ol>
         <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
         <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
